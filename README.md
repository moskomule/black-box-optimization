# black-box-optimization

This repository is (for me) to learn Black-box Optimization (BBO) methods, which do not require gradient information for optimization. Here, I especially focus on methods that are robust to higher dimensional problems.

## Benchmarks

Some benchmarks functions of BBOB are implemented.
